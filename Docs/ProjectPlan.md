# Overview
Ping Ping Pong is a game about being forced to make strategic choices quickly and in rhythm.

Ultimately the gameplay loop will be growing a deck of strike cards that will build out towards particular synergies that will allow you to grow stronger and take on tougher competition over time. When entering a match you will shuffle your own cards in with negative cards from the opponent; 3 will appear at a time and you will need to use a shuffle or select one right as the ball bounces back off the table on your side.

# Plan
POC
- [ ] Display three number randomly chosen from 1-100
- [ ] Visualization of ball as it travels from your side to opponents and back and a line with some guides for where you should hit it
- [ ] Ping pong sound of ball hitting table then opponents racket and back to your table with sound when you swing and make contact
- [ ] Number and timing determine speed of return. Timing gives modifier of .5-1.2 and anything >50 increases the speed once you’ve got up to 100 speed points the opponent misses and you win
- [ ] Ranges to hit the ball are miss (you lose) bad (.5) fine (.8) good (1) and perfect (1.2)
- [ ] As ball speeds up the speed at which you much hit it also speeds up
- [ ] Three numbers displayed in box colored from red (or just white) to green based on score and are triggered by pressing the corresponding arrow key or keypad bu
